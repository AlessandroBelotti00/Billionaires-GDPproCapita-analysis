# Billionaires-GDPproCapita-analysis
The objective of this project is to consider whether the presence of billionaires on the territory leads to an increase in the wealth of the country (in terms of GDP per capita) in 
which they are residents or, more specifically, of the Region or Province. For this purpose, we have chosen to use the data provided online by Forbes magazine regarding the ranking 
of billionaires in the world.
